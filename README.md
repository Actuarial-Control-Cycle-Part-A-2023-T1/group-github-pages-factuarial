##Executive Summary
Weather events have the potential to displace many families and businesses through damage incurred on property. In order to avoid the costs associated with continuous property damage as weather events are projected to increase in both frequency and severity, relocation efforts provide a long-term solution in which climate risk is effectively removed from households.

The primary objective of the proposed program is to reduce displacement risk, increase the safety of residents, provide long-term solutions from property damage costs, reduce financial burden for property owners and reduce the risk of natural hazards sustained by property. To assess the program’s success, the number of households successfully relocated, reduction in property damages and reduction in loss and life will be monitored quarterly and annually.

The proposed insurance scheme outlines a voluntary, proactive relocation scheme as well as involuntary, reactive relocation following a hazard event. Under proactive relocation, households will be able to claim the market value of their existing household and be eligible for additional features involving insurance deductive waivers, subsidised removalist costs, and discounts on improved safety features. Under involuntary relocation, households can claim the market value of their existing property inclusive of property damage sustained during the event.

The proposed program aims to mitigate the risk of natural hazards for high-risk households by offering proactive relocation for the first 25 years. The primary source of costs comes from proactive relocation as it is a priority to quickly reduce the number of houses exposed to severe weather events under the emission scenarios. The program requires Ꝕ715 million in capital to ensure solvency, which can decrease substantially to Ꝕ3 million once proactive relocation is ceased 2050 onwards under the full implementation plan. To mitigate the sudden change in capital holdings, payouts could be distributed over 20 years as an annuity to smooth cost distribution. The economic costs without the program vary under the four emission scenarios with the most notable being under a very high emission scenario.

It is within the government’s best interest to implement an insurance program relocating households out of natural peril prone areas to help Storslysia in managing its exposure from cataclysmic events and prepare for the financial responsibility involved in mass displacement.

## Introduction and Background
Natural disasters can have devastating consequences on human lives, property, and infrastructure. The damage sustained from extreme weather events including but not limited to droughts, bushfires, hail, storms, tornadoes, cyclones have potential to destroy buildings and displace families and businesses. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are projected to increase, the cost of property repairs and home insurance will become exceptionally high, leaving many people uninsured, underinsured, and unprotected. This calls to action a long-term solution to effectively and efficiently mitigate climate risk to individuals in Storslysia.

This report considers five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) in which property damage, frequency, population, and GDP are modelled under (Appendix, A). The frequency and severity of natural hazards are then modelled under these emission assumptions. The SSPs are combined with radiative forcing per square metre which measures the change in energy flux imposed by climate change to create four key emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-3.4, SSP3-6.0 and SSP5-Baseline). The forcing figures can encapsulate changes in “solar energy output, volcanic emissions, deliberate land modification, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and their precursors” (Sorteberg, n.d.).

An analysis of weather events in Storslysia from 1960 to 2020 revealed regions 2, 3 and 4 as having faced higher annual average property damages incurred by hazard events. Between 2010 and 2020, the frequency of disasters trends upwards across all regions, with the impacts being the most significant in regions 2 and 3, and noticeable in regions 4 and 5. This increase is driven by the significant increase in frequency of minor and medium hazards in the past decade. (Appendix, B)
