## Executive Summary
Weather events have the potential to displace many families and businesses through damage incurred on property. In order to avoid the costs associated with continuous property damage as weather events are projected to increase in both frequency and severity, relocation efforts provide a long-term solution in which climate risk is effectively removed from households.

The primary objective of the proposed program is to reduce displacement risk, increase the safety of residents, provide long-term solutions from property damage costs, reduce financial burden for property owners and reduce the risk of natural hazards sustained by property. To assess the program’s success, the number of households successfully relocated, reduction in property damages and reduction in loss and life will be monitored quarterly and annually.

The proposed insurance scheme outlines a voluntary, proactive relocation scheme as well as involuntary, reactive relocation following a hazard event. Under proactive relocation, households will be able to claim the market value of their existing household and be eligible for additional features involving insurance deductive waivers, subsidised removalist costs, and discounts on improved safety features. Under involuntary relocation, households can claim the market value of their existing property inclusive of property damage sustained during the event.

The proposed program aims to mitigate the risk of natural hazards for high-risk households by offering proactive relocation for the first 25 years. The primary source of costs comes from proactive relocation as it is a priority to quickly reduce the number of houses exposed to severe weather events under the emission scenarios. The program requires Ꝕ715 million in capital to ensure solvency, which can decrease substantially to Ꝕ3 million once proactive relocation is ceased 2050 onwards under the full implementation plan. To mitigate the sudden change in capital holdings, payouts could be distributed over 20 years as an annuity to smooth cost distribution. The economic costs without the program vary under the four emission scenarios with the most notable being under a very high emission scenario.

It is within the government’s best interest to implement an insurance program relocating households out of natural peril prone areas to help Storslysia in managing its exposure from cataclysmic events and prepare for the financial responsibility involved in mass displacement.

## Introduction and Background
Natural disasters can have devastating consequences on human lives, property, and infrastructure. The damage sustained from extreme weather events including but not limited to droughts, bushfires, hail, storms, tornadoes, cyclones have potential to destroy buildings and displace families and businesses. As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are projected to increase, the cost of property repairs and home insurance will become exceptionally high, leaving many people uninsured, underinsured, and unprotected. This calls to action a long-term solution to effectively and efficiently mitigate climate risk to individuals in Storslysia.

This report considers five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) in which property damage, frequency, population, and GDP are modelled under (Appendix, A). The frequency and severity of natural hazards are then modelled under these emission assumptions. The SSPs are combined with radiative forcing per square metre which measures the change in energy flux imposed by climate change to create four key emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-3.4, SSP3-6.0 and SSP5-Baseline). The forcing figures can encapsulate changes in “solar energy output, volcanic emissions, deliberate land modification, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and their precursors” (Sorteberg, n.d.).

An analysis of weather events in Storslysia from 1960 to 2020 revealed regions 2, 3 and 4 as having faced higher annual average property damages incurred by hazard events. Between 2010 and 2020, the frequency of disasters trends upwards across all regions, with the impacts being the most significant in regions 2 and 3, and noticeable in regions 4 and 5. This increase is driven by the significant increase in frequency of minor and medium hazards in the past decade. (Appendix, B)

Households in natural peril prone areas face higher risk of sustaining property damage in the event of a hazard. This places financial burden on homeowners to continuously cover the cost of repairs and may also force homeowners to pay extremely high premiums for home and content insurance. Insurance companies may additionally opt out of covering houses within high-risk areas which further exacerbates the burden for high-risk households. Therefore, relocation is considered a final resort in which climate risk is effectively removed altogether. The report covers a proposed insurance scheme aimed at removing climate risk on property by relocating high-risk households in Storslysia to lower risk areas.

## Objectives

The proposed social insurance program is designed to assist the citizens of Storslysia for relocation in order to manage displacement risk arising from cataclysmic weather events. The coverage proposed covers voluntary, proactive relocation as well as involuntary, reactionary relocation with primary focus on moving households out of natural peril prone areas.

The main objectives of our proposed program design:

- Effectively reduce displacement risk arising from relocations by offering government and insurance support in social, economic, and psychological factors.
- Provide long term solutions - by remove climate risk from high-risk households it reduces continually incurred insurance losses from severe weather events.
- Reduce financial burdens on homeowners from property damages incurred by severe weather events and rising home insurance premiums.
- Reduce the risk of natural hazards, reduce the risk posed to people, property, and infrastructure by moving communities away from high-risk areas.
- Ensuring social equity, needs and interest of all members, including low-income residents and marginalised populations. Ensuring the scheme is fair and accessible.

Key metrics to be reported and used to monitor the proposed program’s success:

- Number of households relocated successfully from high-risk areas to low-risk areas. Reported quarterly.
- Reduction in property damage costs following a hazard event. Reported quarterly.
- Cost savings, comparing relocation costs under the relocation program with post-disaster recovery costs. Reported quarterly.
- Reduction in loss of life and injuries by displacing individuals from high risk to low-risk areas. Reported annually.
- Economic benefits, increase to GDP. Reported annually.
- Greenhouse gas emissions, through the subsidisation and additional incentives to use renewable energy sources and low-carbon materials. Reported annually.

It is recommended to report on these key metrics on a regular basis, quarterly or annually to ensure the program is being tracked and assessed in meeting its objectives. Regular reporting also allows for continual adjustments to be made to promote efficacy and longevity.

## Program Design

The program provides the framework for a relocation scheme. Proactive relocation is claimed before a weather event occurs with additional incentives to encourage citizens to voluntarily relocate before a disaster. Involuntary relocation, however, can only be filed post disaster with reduced government payouts. The social insurance program implements a buy-back scheme in which the government purchases a homeowner’s current property and provides them with the funds to relocate to a lower risk area, removing a high-risk house from the property market.

### Proactive relocation

Under a proactive program, citizens will be compensated for their land and house value at market prices and will be eligible for additional incentives outlined in Section 4.4. Under this program, temporary housing is not provided. Proof of acquiring a new property in a low-risk region must be provided in order to be accepted with the transfer of funds contingent upon the purchase of the new property. To be approved, households must satisfy two criteria’s; the household must be from a high-risk region (Regions 2, 3 and 4) and must also be within the top 0.01% of the predictive factor (Appendix, G). Only offered for the first 25 years of program.

### Involuntary relocation

Under involuntary relocation, citizens will only be able to claim their land, household contents and remaining value of their house (market value - property damage) after an event. Temporary housing costs will be further subsidised for a month in the event property damage exceeds 20% of property value for the event being claimed under to allow time to acquire a new property. For claims to be awarded, households must now satisfy three criteria’s; the household must be within a high-risk region, be in the top 5% of the risk rating and must be within the top 0.01% of property damage sustained during the weather event. Assuming this criteria, an estimated 120-200 houses will be eligible for involuntary relocation per hazard event.

### Limitations of coverage

However, relocation under the proposed programs do not cover the full relocation cost to the consumer in the event a purchased property is worth more than their existing one as the government will only purchase the market value of their existing property. The difference in property prices is solely on homeowners. Furthermore, the damage sustained to existing property and household contents are not covered under involuntary relocation schemes. The costs associated with removalist, property acquisition and real estate fees are also not provided under the government buy-back scheme.

### Incentives for proactive relocation

Incentives to encourage voluntary, proactive relocation rather than involuntary relocation:

 - Deductible waivers: Reduce out-of-pocket insurance expenses for homeowners in the event of damage.
 - Improved home safety features: Offer discounts to technologies such as security systems, smoke detectors, house alarms and natural peril resistant measures such as improved roofing, reinforced glass for windows and fire-resistant materials.
 - Moving services: Assist in the relocation process by providing removalists, trucks, and other features. Potentially cover moving expenses for lower property value distribution.
 - Green incentives: Discounts or free sustainable upgrades to technology such as solar panels, and rainwater tanks.
 - Community and council agreements can also be made in which residents are encouraged to move to their regions and in turn offered discounts on relocation costs or housing. Reduced strata rates for apartments, council fees for housing and priority in buying houses can further incentivise people to relocate to safer regions.

### Additional key features

Citizens from a low socio-economic background will receive additional benefits to assist in covering costs associated with relocation to ensure equity and accessibility. Under proactive relocation, an additional Ꝕ50,000 above market value will be provided for property value of Ꝕ0. This benefit will decrease linearly to Ꝕ0 for property value up to Ꝕ150,000 such that for every Ꝕ30,000 increase in property value, the additional payout will reduce by Ꝕ10,000.

Those with lower than median incomes will also be allowed to take out government-backed loans for their new property which would reduce market borrowing rates. Furthermore, a reduction in house deposits may be offered to citizens with low income to assist in their purchase of a new home in a safer region. All these benefits, however, call upon an additional criterion to distinguish which residents would be eligible for the supplementary assistance.

Under the very high emission scenario, frequency and severity are both expected to increase exponentially which further increases the risk of incurring cataclysmic weather events. Whilst the government initiates relocation insurance schemes, action can be taken to reduce CO2 emissions in parallel. A consideration includes using bought-back land as location for renewable energy plants such as wind farms, solar panels, and hydropower dams to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. Governments can also prioritise sustainable transportation practices by building bike lanes and sidewalks and investing in public transport infrastructure to reduce the number of cars on the road. Reduction in waste can be encouraged by compost and recycling schemes with an abolishment of single use plastic. Homeowners can also be encouraged to be environmentally conscious by being offered discounts on eco-friendly upgrades including updating insulations and investing in energy efficient appliances.

### Qualitative justifications

A) The buy-back program is available under both involuntary and proactive relocation schemes for households exposed to higher risk. For proactive relocation, homeowners can claim the market value of their property in exchange for their ownership of the house in a low-risk region. For involuntary relocation however, homeowners can only claim the market value of their home minus the property damage that was incurred due to the disaster. This provides the incentive to relocate voluntarily before a weather event to receive the full market value of their property.

B) Temporary housing will be provided for renters and homeowners who relocate involuntarily to a low-risk region and sustain property damage greater 20% of their property value in an event. Temporary housing will be provided for one month only after the disaster to provide sufficient time for individuals to find another property.

C) The additional assistance provided to households from a low socio-economic background has been established to support relocation of individuals with low property value and low income. By reducing house deposits and offering government backed loans, it will assist individuals with low incomes in acquiring funds to purchase a new home. It will ensure the social insurance scheme is equitable, accessible, and fair without exacerbating financial inequality between demographics and regions.

### Quantitive justifications

1. Market value of property will be provided under proactive relocation with adjusted property value offered under involuntary relocation.
Under the buy-back government scheme, the idea is to relocate households to lower risk areas in order to avoid paying continually incurred property damage. With a one-off lump sum payment to facilitate relocation, costs with recovery efforts will be substantially minimised.

2. Temporary housing is provided under involuntary relocations for the first month.
This program feature was designed to assist victims of natural disasters as they readjust and seek accommodation. As temporary housing costs are insignificant, sensitivity analyses show that adjusting the amount of time that temporary housing is subsidised is immaterial to the costs of the program.
 
3. Property value below Ꝕ150,000 will be eligible for higher payouts in the form of market value under involuntary relocation and above market value under proactive relocation.
This is to assist in the purchase of a new home where the market value of their existing property is insufficient to purchase a home in a new region given higher house prices. The combination of low median household income, high poverty rate, and low property value (Appendix, J) suggest that region 4 is the poorest out of the six regions and combined with being a high-risk region, region 4 will require the most assistance. Therefore, the threshold for Ꝕ150,000 allows for 50% of region 4’s population to claim the additional funds.

4. The Ꝕ50,000 benefit will decrease linearly to Ꝕ0 for property values up to Ꝕ150,000 i.e. for every Ꝕ30,000 increase in property value, the additional payout will reduce by Ꝕ10,000. 
This program feature aims to assist those of low socio-economic status so that they are not excluded from the relocation benefits due to financial hardships. This specific method maintains the wealth distribution of citizens to ensure fairness to those whose properties lie above the Ꝕ150,000 threshold.

## Pricing and Costs
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229791516-b7027e5d-67f0-4a15-8674-b455eca69003.png) 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229791531-819ac7a3-e1bd-4c0e-8b27-71be656196b1.png)

The source of program costs primarily come from the proactive relocation feature of the scheme. The scheme heavily prioritises and encourages proactive relocation within the 25 years it is being offered and thus, with so many houses being bought back, costs to the government will initially be high. Thus, proactive relocation is the dominant source of expenditure throughout the program’s first 25 years as observed in the figures below. Involuntary costs decrease over time for the SSP1 and SSP2 emission scenarios, but for higher emissions scenarios, we see a growth over time, especially for SSP4. This justifies the large costs incurred for proactive relocation as it is more beneficial to quickly reduce the number of houses exposed, than allow them to be impacted by the severe natural disasters of the high emission scenarios.

Thus, it is recommended to initially hold Ꝕ715 million in capital to ensure the risk of insolvency is below 0.01% for all emission scenarios. Once proactive relocation is no longer offered, from 2050 onwards, capital holdings can decrease dramatically to 3 million. The program will no longer see high levels of activity beyond 2050 as most high-risk homes have already been relocated to maximise economic benefit. (Appendix, K)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229791651-9a767be3-ad99-46e5-82e8-aef959702403.png)

However, this capital structure may not be ideal for implementation - a possible strategy to mitigate this sudden change in capital holdings would be to offer the payout as an annuity over several years (20 years) to smooth out the distribution of costs.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229791694-4e30bd96-fc97-494d-86e3-ce7b4a48c06e.png)

The economic costs without the program varies under the four emission scenarios with the most notable being under a very high emission scenario in which cost rise exponentially. These figures exceed the cost with the program as recovery efforts and continuous property damages are sustained to households in high-risk areas. It is therefore in the governments best interest to implement the proposed scheme to reduce the cost post-disaster and eliminate climate risk from high-risk households.

## Assumptions
A. Damage proportion caused by houses by each class of event is assumed to follow log-normal distribution with mean of 0 and normal deviation added to simulate randomness. Distribution is right skewed and non-negative which largely conforms to claim expectations. Standard deviation fitted so projects would fall within historical expectations.

B. Property damage proportions for each type of event falls within the following ranges:
Major: 0-70%, Minor: 0-10%, Medium: 0-30%. These ranges appeared to be the most appropriate under our classifications of events.

C. Natural disasters occurring across multiple regions are considered as different and independent events. The modelling approach projects disasters in each region individually.

D. Stamp duty, administration fees, taxes or real estate commission are not included in total costs of relocation. There is a lack of data to account for these costs within the model.

E. Population size of each region will grow proportionally to the projected world population. No other information provided on Storslysia’s population growth.

F. Storslysia GDP will grow proportionally to the projected increase in global GDP. No other information provided on Storslysia’s GDP growth.

G. Citizens will relocate to a house of equal value to their existing property. Most citizens will purchase property of comparable value so any deviation in cost will likely even out.

H. No government intervention to build new houses. Invisible Hand Principle: supply for houses will meet demand as construction companies identify opportunities of business.

I. All housing costs (including property value) will rise with projected inflation. Governments will likely implement policies to prevent abnormally inflated property prices in safe regions.

J. Citizens relocating will be completed beginning of the following year to simplify the model.

## Risk and Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Qualitative risk
#### *Issues with accessibility to workplaces and employment transition upon relocation*

Government can offer payments for individuals over the age of 18 and those actively seeking new employment after relocation. These payments will be available for one year or until the individual is able to find employment. New regulations can also be enforced for a hybrid working environment within workplaces to assist the citizens in adjusting to new workplaces.

#### *Desertion of high-risk areas upon relocation*

Utilise empty land for sustainable activities such as tree plantations, solar farms, and wind farms to help control the emission levels apart from having a use in those empty areas. Land can also be used for community gardens to encourage more social interactions and community bonding.

#### *Emotional distress and anxiety due to sudden relocation.*

Implement counselling and support programs to console and assist families. Promote and organise community events to elevate a sense of belonging and inclusivity.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229792481-fe868dc6-d0e2-4590-acae-c6d356fc5f78.png)

### Quantifiable risk
#### *Local businesses will be affected as customers relocate out of high-risk regions.*

Possible mitigation includes providing financial assistance such as cash-back deals, vouchers, and increased marketing of small businesses. Further assistance may also be provided to small business to relocate to low-risk regions to promote sales. Approximately Ꝕ89mil, Ꝕ18mil and Ꝕ12mil decline in sales are expected in regions 2, 3 and 4 respectively. (Appendix, L)

#### *The government pay-out is insufficient to purchase a new property in a low-risk region due to a lower value property market in certain regions.*

Property values in low-risk regions will be significantly higher than areas of high-risk as market prices encapsulate climate risk to property and land. Therefore, pay-outs may be insufficient to purchase new property. Approximately, Ꝕ32,061 difference between average property value and the minimum threshold of Ꝕ150,000. (Appendix, M)

#### *Climate circumstances may worsen and result in larger severities and frequencies of natural disasters.*

Under increasing emission scenarios, frequency and severity increase which poses greater risk to property and land. Mitigation therefore includes using bought-back land as renewable energy farms, encourage upgrades to eco-friendly appliances and invest in sustainable infrastructure.

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Standard deviation**: Adjusting the change in standard deviation used in log normal model.

**Impact**: Change in the average proportion of damages incurred on each house after an event.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229793443-6d87c996-7b5a-4674-abae-09db3aebe284.png)

**Truncation**: Adjusting the limits imposed on possible damage proportions. 

**Impact**: Changes in the average proportion damages incurred on each house after an event.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229793593-dfdf4f44-b2bd-46fb-a46e-eeedbd217260.png)

**Frequency**: Adjusting the inputs into the frequency model (number of events in 2020).

**Impact**: For all SSP scenarios and classification of events, any change in inputs to frequency will result in a proportional change in projected frequencies.

**Example**: increasing the expected number of minor events in 2020 by 10% would reflect a 10% increase in the frequency of minor events across all years and SSP scenarios.

### Degree of certainty program exceeding 10% of GDP

Costs of relocation with the program in place lie well below the 10% GDP limit and falls more after the initial 25 years of proactive relocation as costs cease and economic benefits are reaped. For each emission scenario, there is a 99% certainty that the economic costs arising from relocation will remain lower than the following percentages of GDP:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229793833-165ce88d-f74d-4d7c-8e9b-955d8baf8a9d.png)

### Degree of certainty of cost-saving with and without program

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433109/229794069-5f954afd-e5ad-43f1-8629-a89ffc4ece0b.png)

In the first 25 years of the program of proactive relocation, the cost of the scheme will outweigh the economic benefits. However, after the end of this period, costs significantly drop and the probability of a loss (annual economic benefit – annual cost) falls to almost 0 - with 98.4% confidence that the annual cost will not outweigh the economic benefit for the years 2045 and beyond. The benefit of this scheme is distributed across all future years as cost savings accumulate with time. As this insurance scheme works as a preventative measure, the initial expenses will be large as the government is investing in long-term economic health.

Total damage (Ꝕ) prevented over full 130 years of relocation implementation:

## Data and Data Limitations

A. No claim data provided per household, only aggregated data per region. Therefore, damage severity to each household was simulated which may not reflect actual experience.

B. No housing availability data within each region and therefore, unable to determine how many people can move to each region, amount of available housing, capacity to build new property and the insufficient data describing infrastructure to support a growing population.

C. Due to a lack of data regarding relocation period length, simplifying assumptions were made that relocation will be concluded in the following year.

D. Unable to account for the impact of private home and contents insurance due to lack of data of coverage, premium prices, and proportion of households with insurance. Home and contents insurance has the potential to impact the insurance scheme. After an event occurs, individuals would now have the option to repair property from insurance and then claim proactive relocation, receiving a higher government pay out than involuntary relocation.

---

## Conclusion

The proposed social insurance scheme provides the framework for involuntary and proactive relocation in which market value compensation is offered for households moving out of high-risk regions. The program provides substantial cost saving measures and requires Ꝕ715 million in capital to ensure solvency, dropping to Ꝕ3 million once proactive relocation has ceased. Given these cost-reduction measures and a reduction in climate risk on property and land, the social insurance scheme is heavily recommended for implementation in Storslysia.
